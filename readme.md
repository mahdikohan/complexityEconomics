# About Me
Hi, I'm **Mahdi Kohan Sefidi** and I have a Master's degree in economics. I am interested in complexity economics and computer simulations. Now, I would like to share some information about this subject and present some interesting things about it. Let's explore this together, guys! ðŸ˜Š

# Complexity Economics

Complexity economics is the application of complexity science to the problems of economics. It relaxes several common assumptions in economics, including general equilibrium theory. While it does not reject the existence of an equilibrium, it sees such equilibria as "a special case of nonequilibrium", and as an emergent property resulting from complex interactions between economic agents [1].

Complexity economics is the study of economic systems as complex systems, which consist of interacting individuals that change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. Complexity economists study the emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy and they regularly dispense with the assumptions of individual optimization and/or systemic equilibrium usually employed in the mainstream [2].

One example of a problem studied in complexity economics is the **El Farol Bar problem** [5].

The El Farol Bar problem is a problem in game theory where a fixed population wants to go to the El Farol Bar every Thursday night, unless it's too crowded. If less than 60% of the population goes to the bar, they'll all have more fun than if they stayed home. If more than 60% of the population goes to the bar, they'll all have less fun than if they stayed home. Everyone must decide at the same time whether to go or not, with no knowledge of others' choices [5]. This problem is a popular paradigm of complex economic systems in which agents self-organize themselves while they are in competition for a limited resource, without possibility of communication [6].

## Institutions of New Economic Thinking

There are several institutions dedicated to promoting new economic thinking, including:

- The **Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET)**: A New York City-based nonprofit think tank founded in October 2009 as a result of the 2007â€“2012 global financial crisis. It runs a variety of affiliated programs at major universities such as the Cambridge-INET Institute at the University of Cambridge [7].
- The **Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School (INET Oxford)**: A multidisciplinary research institute dedicated to applying leading-edge thinking from the social and physical sciences to global economic challenges [8].
